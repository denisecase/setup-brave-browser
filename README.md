# Setup Brave Browser

Get started with the Brave web browser, a Chromium-based, privacy-centered browser that runs on Windows, Mac, Android, and more.

## Brave Web Browser

Brave is a fast, secure, privacy-centered browser built on Chromium.
It blocks trackers and ads by default, does not collect personal browsing data, and allows users to isolate work and personal contexts using Profiles.

This guide helps install Brave and configure it with a strong privacy-first focus.

1. Open Brave
2. Go to Settings / Shields
   - Trackers & Ads Blocking: Aggressive
   - Upgrade connections to HTTPS: Enabled
   - Block fingerprinting: Strict

These settings will be the defaults for all profiles. They can be overwritten as desired for specific profiles.

## 3. Create Browser Profiles

Profiles create completely separate browsing environments for work, personal, or anonymous use.

To create a profile:

1. Click the profile icon in the top-right corner
2. Select: Add Profile
3. Choose a name (e.g., "Work", "Personal", "Guest", "Anonymous")
4. Optionally set a unique color theme or icon

Each profile has its own:
- Bookmarks
- Cookies and login sessions
- Extensions
- Privacy overrides

---

## 4. Customize Each Profile

Switch to each profile and adjust settings as needed.

For example:
- In Work: allow necessary cookies, log into trusted platforms
- In Personal: block all third-party cookies, use stricter privacy settings
- In Anonymous: use private windows or clear history on close

Profiles can be used to pin tabs, install specific extensions, or sync settings (using Brave Sync) as desired.
