# Setup Brave Browser

Get started with the Brave web browser, a Chromium-based, privacy-centered browser that runs on Windows, Mac, Android, and more.

## Brave Web Browser

Brave is a fast, secure, privacy-centered browser built on Chromium.
It blocks trackers and ads by default, does not collect personal browsing data, and allows users to isolate work and personal contexts using Profiles.

This guide helps install Brave and configure it with a strong privacy-first focus.

## 1. Install Brave

Visit the official Brave download page:

[https://brave.com/download](https://brave.com/download)

Brave is available for:
- Windows
- macOS
- Linux
- Android
- iOS

Download and install the version for your device. No account is required.

## Note on Adobe PDF Integration
After installation, the main menu in the upper-left corner of Brave may display "Error". 
This may be triggered by Brave’s new Adobe Acrobat PDF integration, which is recommended by Brave but optional.

When clicked, Brave will ask whether you want to:

- Keep Adobe PDF App - Continue using the enhanced Adobe Acrobat PDF features (such as fill, sign, and comment). Choose this if you want richer PDF tools directly in the browser.

- Remove the Adobe PDF App - Revert to Brave’s built-in PDF viewer, which is fast, private, and often more stable. This is recommended if you prefer simplicity and privacy.

If unsure, feel free to remove it. It can always be installed later as desired.

## 2. Set Global Privacy Settings

After installation:

1. Open Brave. Click on the main menu (☰ in the upper right). Click "Settings". 
3. On the Settings page, click the ☰ menu (in the upper left), then click **Shields**.
4. Adjust the global defaults as needed to set: 
   - Trackers & Ads Blocking: Aggressive
   - Upgrade connections to HTTPS: Strict
   - Block scripts: Off
   - Block fingerprinting: On
   - Block cookies: Block third-party cookies
   - Forget me when I close this site: On
   - Store contact information for future broken site reports: Optional
   - Allow Facebook logins and embedded posts: Off
   - Allow X embedded tweets: Off
   - Allow LinkedIn embedded posts: Off
5. On the Settings page, click the ☰ menu (in the upper left), then click **Privacy and Security**
   - WebRTC IP handling policy: Disable non-proxied UDP
   - Allow the data collection options if you like - they are safe and helpful.

These global settings will be defaulted for all profiles.
Settings can be overwritten as desired for specific profiles.

## 3. Create Browser Profiles

Profiles create completely separate browsing environments for work, personal, or anonymous use.

To create a profile:

1. Click on the main menu (☰ in the upper right). Click "More Tools" / "Add new profile".
2. Enter a profile name (e.g., "Work", "Personal", "Guest", "Anonymous")
3. Optionally set a unique color theme or icon

Each profile has its own:
- Bookmarks
- Cookies and login sessions
- Extensions
- Privacy overrides

## 4. Customize Each Profile

You may get the error again. Make your choice for Adobe PDF again and either skip or import your content from other browsers (e.g. Chrome or Edge) as desired. 
Adjust profile settings as needed. 

For example:
- In Work: allow necessary cookies, log into trusted platforms
- In Personal: block all third-party cookies, use stricter privacy settings
- In Anonymous: use private windows or clear history on close

Profiles can be used to pin tabs, install specific extensions, or sync settings (using Brave Sync) as desired.
